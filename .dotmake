# This script exploits the DevX Spaces + Github Codespaces default behavior:
#   "If there's no install script in your dotfiles, we symlink any files that
#    start with '.'"
#
# We don't really want to have a static set of auto-linked dotfiles.  So we
# offer this one exception:  ~/.dotmake -> [dotfiles-path]/.dotmake, which
# can then be manually invoked from anywhere to zap the user settings.
#
#  About "App setup"
#  -----------------
#  Setup hook makefiles can be present in any top-level
#  git WC if the following names exist (order matters):
#
#       me/.dotfiles.mk
#       me/dotfiles.mk
#       me/spaces-dotfiles.mk
#       .dotfiles.mk
#       dotfiles.mk
#       spaces-dotfiles.mk
#
#    For all such files, we:
#     - 'cd' to the dir containing the .git/ tree first
#     - invoke the default target
#     - the ordering within a dir is always [.dotfiles.mk, dotfiles.mk,spaces-dotfiles.mk]
#     - any error in any hook aborts the entire hook sequence remaining
#
#   (See inc/app-setup.mk for more)
